├── README.md              # This file
├── src/                   # Helper classes and core logic (e.g., NMF helper functions)
├── notebooks/             # Exploratory notebooks and documentation of the pipeline execution
├── tests/                 # Unit tests for core functions
├── scripts/               # Production-ready, sequential analytical scripts
├── data/                  # Storage for processed data files (e.g., .pkl files)
└── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies


2. Setup and Execution

2.1. Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.8+ installed. All required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

To install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2.2. Data Input

This pipeline assumes a raw CSV file named financial_news.csv (or similar, as configured in the scripts) containing at least three columns:

A timestamp column (timestamp).

The full headline text (headline).

The source/publisher name (publisher).

2.3. Analysis Pipeline Execution

The entire analytical workflow is split into four sequential scripts in the scripts/ directory, ensuring modularity and reproducibility.

python scripts/data_cleaning.py
python scripts/topic_modeling.py
python scripts/time_series_analysis.py
python scripts/publisher_specialization.py
